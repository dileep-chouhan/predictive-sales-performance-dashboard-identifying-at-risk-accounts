# Predictive Sales Performance Dashboard: Identifying At-Risk Accounts

## Overview

This project develops a predictive sales performance dashboard designed to proactively identify sales accounts at risk of churn.  The analysis leverages historical sales data and market trends to build a predictive model.  This allows sales teams to intervene early and improve sales retention rates. The dashboard provides visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) to facilitate informed decision-making.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the necessary Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key statistics and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the following visualization files will be generated in the project directory:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line plot visualizing overall sales trends over time.
* `at_risk_accounts.png`: A bar chart or other suitable visualization identifying the top at-risk accounts.  (Specific visualization type may vary depending on the model and data.)

Further visualizations and detailed output might be added based on model refinements and future development.  Please refer to the code for specific details on the generated output.
